# TODO app test training

This project is just to practice myself some testing in a Angular project and others in a Api with Express + Typescript and MongoDB.

It is a simple todo list in one page. There are more features that I can do, but little by little. The goal is practice and have a application example, not a final project.

Probably I will do the same application in others frameworks like React, Vue and Svelte.

## Angular Client
Go to [./angular-client](./angular-client) folder to join the web application.

## API
Go to [./api](./api) folder to join the web api.


## How to run?
In this folder, open a terminal and run `docker-compose up`. This will create 3 containers.
 - client: Web application -> port `4200`
 - api: Web rest api -> port `3002`
 - mongo: Mongo database -> port `27017`

Keep in mind to have this ports free before run.
